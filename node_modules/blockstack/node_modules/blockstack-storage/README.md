# Blockstack Storage JS

**Please don't use this library directly as its API will change. Instead use Blockstack Storage via the
public APIs provided in [blockstack.js](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js).**

This library was split off from [blockstack.js](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js)
in order to make it easier to test.

Documentation of the unstable APIs in this library are available in [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md)
